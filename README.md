# Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv8n

## Project Summary
This project is designed to detect brain tumors from MRI images using the YOLOv8n (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The goal is to offer a quick and accurate tool for identifying tumors in MRI scans, supporting early diagnosis and potential treatment decisions. Trained on a dataset of 19,000 images, the model performs with high precision and accuracy. A user-friendly interface enables users to upload images and detect tumors in real time.

## Motivation
This project is part of an innovative assignment for the Drone Lab at Scaler School of Technology, focusing on applying technology to real-world problems. Detecting brain tumors is a critical task due to the life-threatening implications if not identified early. Manual analysis of MRI images is time-intensive and subject to human error, so this project leverages deep learning to aid radiologists with faster, more accurate diagnoses.
